Gotchas:

Getting a Hello World to work on localhost (front-end + backend) is quite a mission.

There's a persistent CORS error, that can be seen in Chrome DevTools when you click the button, making the request.

ðŸ”¹ The first suggestion from GPT4 is to actually _serve_ the frontend, rather than simply opening the index.html in Chrome (which results in an origin of None rather than localhost:port)

This is done by (from the frontend folder) doing: `python -m http.server`
That will serve a frontend on port 8000, so open a Chrome tab at: http://localhost:8000/

ðŸ”¹ There's an initial warning/error due to lack of favicon.ico (which seems to be a universally expected file, I think it's the icon that appears in the browser window). Just creating an empty file (temp) fixes.

After this ensued a long conversation with GPT4:

ðŸ”¹ One issue was that my backend port (5000) was already in use by my MacOS. There's some core service that uses it, so it's a really bad default choice.

Solution here is to specify a different port from which the backend is to be served, and update the frontend code accordingly. I've chosen 15007:
```
    app.run(debug=True, port=15007)
```

Now this STILL doesn't shake it loose, and I ended up having to go back to the stone age, sorry, Google / StackOverflow, and splat a couple of articles into GPT4.

ðŸ”¹ The final fix was indeed a modification to the CORS line:

```
app = Flask(__name__)
# CORS(app)
# CORS(app, origins='*', methods='*', allow_headers=['Content-Type'])
# CORS(app, origins=['http://localhost:8000'], methods='*', allow_headers=['Content-Type'], supports_credentials=True)

CORS(app, origins='*', methods=['POST', 'OPTIONS'], allow_headers=['Content-Type', 'Authorization'], supports_credentials=True)
```

Now that it's working, a reasonable next step would be to incrementally push the code back towards a minimal Hello World, and identify the crucial code change(s).
